                        Finally, I got around to getting my first MG kit from the 00 series, one of my favourites from the Gundam shows I've watched thus far.
                        This also happens to be my favourite Mobile Suit from any of the series I've watched, the sniper role with the gun camera that is hidden
                        behind the V-fin is so cool to me, not to mention the stud of a pilot that Lockon Stratos is. Coincidentally, I've also heard that this
                        is the Master Grade of all Master Grades; meaning this kit is far and away the best Master Grade kit Bandai has to offer. As such, I
                        decided that I had to throw everything and the kitchen sink at this kit to make it far and away the best kit I've ever done. This kit
                        is going to have LED lights not just in the eyes, but in the GN-Drive, and behind all the clear parts in both the legs and the arms with
                        the option to flip a switch to enable Trans-Am mode to change most of the LEDs to red using Arduinos and lots and lots of micro-leds.

                    <h2 className="Section">The Build</h2>
                    <p className="Post-Text">
                        Like all other Gundam kits from Bandai, there's no glue required to assemble anything in the base kit, which is a nice change of pace from some
                        of the other kits I usually build. The engineering on how the sections are build is incredibly impressive, definitely earning the kit it's
                        reputation as one of the best Bandai has ever made. It's certainly the best Master Grade I've built thus far, that's for sure. To give an example,
                        the moveable V-fin that sits on Dyanmes' head hides the Gun Camera it uses for sniping when not in use, but the 2 halves of the head sandwitch a
                        part that slides back and forth to allow the V-fin to rotate down, covering the eyes and revealing the Gun Camera. Clever engineering like this is
                        everywhere on this kit and it's very evident that a lot of love and care went into the design of the parts.
                    </p>
                    <p className="Post-Text">
                        Because of all this care taken in the design, the built has some of the best posability of any Gundam in my collection thus far. The amount of
                        movement it has even in the torso alone puts many other kits to shame. This of course, let me have hours of fun meticulously trying to get the
                        kit in the right poses for some cool photos before I moved onto the next step of the build.

                        With this kit being one of my favourites ever, I wanted to really up the detail to a new level. I'm not quite at the level where I'm super confident
                        in my ability to create a ton of extra details from PLA sheets, putty, and scribe extra panel lines in a way that actually looks good, so I chose
                        a different option to take this kit to the next level: Fortune Meow Studio's Resin Conversion Kit. This additional part set adds a ton of extra and
                        replacement parts for the base kit that are cast out of resin to have a ton more detail. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="Post-Text">
                        <b>A WORD OF WARNING</b>: Resin dust is very bad for your health and it should not be inhaled at all. All the parts were assembled and prepped in my
                        spray booth to pull dust away from my face. Additionally, a ton of ventilation was used to keep fresh air circulating in my room and a full
                        respirator was worn at all time during sanding and assembly. Afterwards, you should wipe down any surfaces that might contain resin dust with a wet
                        paper towel to make sure the majority of dust is removed from your work area.
                    </p>
                    <p className="Post-Text">
                        Once I got this kit in the mail, it was just a matter of working through the instructions and finding which parts needed to be replaced from the
                        original kit. This was a bit harder and more time consuming than I had originally imagined it would be since I couldn't actually read the language
                        the instructions were printed in, so all I had to go off was the pictures they offered. It went quite well overall but it did take me some time to
                        wrack my brain and figure out how they moved from step to step in some sections. I did give myself a bit of a scare too when assembling one of the
                        arms from the conversion kit. The replacement elbow joint sits inside another armour piece to make it fit better with the other arm parts. Well, I,
                        in my infinite wisdom, decided that using some super thin CA glue to hold these parts together was the absolute best idea. What I didn't consider at
                        the time was, "Well, what if this thin glue seeps into the elbow joint itself?", and you'd never guess that that's exactly what happened. I had to
                        frantically pull the parts apart so the arm wouldn't permenantly be stuck in a super awkward position and in, doing that, I ended up gluing a part of
                        my glove to some one of the resin parts that needed to be sanded out.
                    </p>
                    <p className="Post-Text">
                        Despite this escapade though, the rest of the kit went together really well all things considered. I didn't glue any other resin parts together besides
                        the elbow joints into their housing so that the kit would actually come apart so that I can airbrush it, so in some of the pictures, they're all just
                        precariously hanging onto the kit by whatever little bit of fricition they have between each other. You can see some of the before and after pictures
                        for some of the parts below to get an idea of the level of deatil I'm talking about.

                        Some of the pictures of the kit with all the resin pieces on it aren't the best since, as I mentioned above, the parts are basically hanging on by just
                        hope. It took me a long time to get all the parts even to stay on for these pictures. Despite this though, I'm incredibly happy with the level of detail
                        the parts added to the kit. I think it makes it look much cooler and so much more interesting than some of the plain, flat parts that came in the base kit.
